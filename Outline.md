# Game Outline

## Controls
There are three types of levels within the game and each has their own controls, though all of them just use the mouse. The level select screen is also navigated only with the mouse. Additionally, you can return to the level select screen from anywhere by pressing the Home key.

### Learning Levels
Text is advanced by simply left-clicking with the mouse. There is nothing else to it as the goal is learning the necessary information for the other types of levels.

### Shooting Levels
The ship points towards the mouse cursor and fires a shot when the left mouse button is pressed. The goal is to destroy the asteroid that has the conjugation on it that corresponds with the question given in the bottom left.

### Connecting Levels
Simply left-clicking on one of the train cars will lock it in as your selected answer to the question. The goal is to link the train car with the corresponding conjugation to the train with the question on it. The train cars move automatically after they have been clicked on.

## Characteristics
The goal of the game is to learn and practice French verb conjugation. This is done through teaching how to conjugate a verb or group of verbs and then practicing it in a space-shooter-style level afterwards. Once the player is confident in their ability to recognize the correct conjugation they move on to the connecting levels which mix more than one verb together. This process continues until they hae mastered all of the verbs and conjugations thereof that this game contains.
